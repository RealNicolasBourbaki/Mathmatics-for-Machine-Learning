# Mathmatics-for-Machine-Learning

Math could be intimidating to people who are not fully comfortable with the symbolical, mathmatical language. Therefore, since I'm reviewing all the Math I have learned this semester, I guess it is a good thing to organize and upload my notes up here. Although the layout of those docs looks boring and rigid, that is just because I'm lazy and do not want to put more time into layout design (ha, I guess it's a good thing that I quit to be a designer). The content is fun and easy to understand (or at least I hope so) since I have translated the math equations into normal English (and sometimes, questionable jokes). 

## Contents

1. Linear Algebra
2. Multivariate Calculus
3. Optimization
4. Probability and Statistics
5. Phenomena in High Dimensions
6. Approximation Theory
7. Functional Analysis, etc..
